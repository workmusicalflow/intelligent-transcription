# ADR-002: Use Vue.js 3 with Composition API for Frontend

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-05-30

**Authors:** Frontend Team

**Reviewers:** Technical Lead

## Context

The Intelligent Transcription application needs a modern, reactive frontend that can:

1. Handle real-time updates (transcription progress, chat messages)
2. Provide excellent user experience with responsive design
3. Support complex state management across components
4. Enable easy testing and maintenance
5. Integrate with WebSocket connections and GraphQL subscriptions
6. Support progressive web app (PWA) features

The initial implementation used plain JavaScript with jQuery, which became difficult to maintain as the application grew in complexity.

## Decision

We will use Vue.js 3 with the Composition API as our frontend framework, along with:

1. **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
2. **Composition API**: For better logic reuse and TypeScript integration
3. **Pinia**: For state management (Vue 3's recommended store)
4. **Vue Router 4**: For client-side routing
5. **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
6. **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: Vue 3's improved reactivity system and smaller bundle size
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration provides compile-time error checking
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling with Vite, Vue DevTools, and IDE support
- **Composition API**: Better logic reuse and organization for complex components
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with official libraries and community support
- **Real-time**: Excellent WebSocket and subscription support
- **Testing**: Great testing utilities with Vue Test Utils

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Composition API patterns
- **Migration**: Requires rewriting existing jQuery-based code
- **Bundle Size**: Framework overhead compared to vanilla JavaScript
- **Complexity**: More sophisticated build process and tooling

### Neutral

- **SEO**: Single Page Application requires consideration for SEO (not critical for our app)
- **Browser Support**: Vue 3 requires modern browsers (acceptable for our use case)

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: React with TypeScript

**Description:** Use React with hooks and TypeScript

**Pros:**
- Large ecosystem and community
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Strong testing tools
- Good performance with concurrent features

**Cons:**
- More boilerplate code
- State management requires additional libraries
- JSX syntax learning curve
- Larger bundle size

**Decision:** Rejected - More complex setup and steeper learning curve

### Option 2: Svelte/SvelteKit

**Description:** Use Svelte for compile-time optimizations

**Pros:**
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Simple syntax
- Built-in state management
- Excellent performance

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem
- Less mature tooling
- Limited TypeScript support at the time
- Fewer developers familiar with it

**Decision:** Rejected - Ecosystem and team familiarity concerns

### Option 3: Vue 2 with Options API

**Description:** Use the previous Vue version with familiar patterns

**Pros:**
- Team familiarity
- Stable ecosystem
- Easier migration from jQuery
- Well-documented patterns

**Cons:**
- Limited TypeScript support
- Performance limitations
- End of life approaching
- Harder logic reuse

**Decision:** Rejected - Vue 3 provides significant advantages

### Option 4: Alpine.js with vanilla JavaScript

**Description:** Lightweight framework for progressive enhancement

**Pros:**
- Very small footprint
- Easy to learn
- Progressive enhancement
- Good for simple interactions

**Cons:**
- Limited for complex applications
- No built-in routing
- Minimal state management
- Poor TypeScript support

**Decision:** Rejected - Insufficient for complex real-time features

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Project setup and basic structure
   - Initialize Vite project with Vue 3 and TypeScript
   - Set up Tailwind CSS and basic styling
   - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and testing tools
   - Create basic layout components

2. **Phase 2**: Core application features
   - Implement authentication views and logic
   - Create transcription upload and management interfaces
   - Set up Pinia stores for state management
   - Implement Vue Router for navigation

3. **Phase 3**: Real-time features
   - Integrate WebSocket connections
   - Implement real-time transcription progress
   - Add chat interface with live updates
   - Set up GraphQL subscriptions

4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features
   - Implement PWA capabilities
   - Add offline support where appropriate
   - Optimize performance and bundle size
   - Comprehensive testing suite

5. **Phase 5**: Polish and optimization
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Performance optimization
   - User experience enhancements
   - Production deployment preparation

## Success Metrics

How will we know if this decision was successful?

- **Performance**: Page load times < 2 seconds, runtime performance smooth
- **Developer Productivity**: New features implemented faster than with jQuery
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript catches type errors, ESLint prevents common issues
- **Test Coverage**: >80% coverage for components and composables
- **User Experience**: Positive feedback on interface responsiveness
- **Bundle Size**: Total bundle < 500KB gzipped
- **Real-time Performance**: WebSocket updates feel instantaneous
