Should you learn PHP in 2024? Dirty old PHP. PHP is an extremely capable web programming language. It is the most popular web programming language in the world today in terms of server-side programming. So many sites use it, and if you especially want to get into freelance, PHP is super useful. That all said, what you'll find is PHP shares many of the same qualities as so many other languages, so once you learn PHP, you'll learn a lot about many other programming languages, and it's the easiest, quickest way to learn full-stack development and back-end development. So yeah, PHP is 100% relevant in 2024. If you're getting into WordPress, there's another example. PHP is king. All right, we'll talk soon. Bye-bye. I'm Uncle Steph.",
