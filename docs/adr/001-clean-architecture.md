# ADR-001: Adopt Clean Architecture for Backend

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2024-05-30

**Authors:** Development Team

**Reviewers:** Architecture Team

## Context

The Intelligent Transcription application needs a robust backend architecture that can:

1. Scale with growing user demands
2. Maintain clean separation of concerns
3. Enable easy testing and maintenance
4. Support multiple interfaces (REST API, GraphQL, CLI)
5. Integrate with external services (OpenAI, YouTube)

The initial implementation was a monolithic PHP application with tightly coupled components, making it difficult to test and extend.

## Decision

We will adopt Clean Architecture principles for the backend, implementing:

1. **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (database, APIs, web framework)
4. **Interface Layer**: Controllers and adapters

Key patterns to implement:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Dependency inversion for testability

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently of external dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap out infrastructure components (database, external APIs)
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling and microservices evolution
- **Domain Focus**: Business rules are clearly expressed in the domain layer

### Negative

- **Complexity**: More files and layers increase initial complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Clean Architecture principles
- **Development Time**: Initial setup takes longer than simple CRUD operations
- **Over-engineering Risk**: May be excessive for simple CRUD operations

### Neutral

- **File Structure**: More organized but requires adherence to conventions
- **Performance**: No significant impact on runtime performance

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Laravel Framework

**Description:** Use Laravel's MVC architecture with Eloquent ORM

**Pros:**
- Fast development
- Rich ecosystem
- Built-in features (auth, validation, etc.)
- Large community

**Cons:**
- Framework coupling
- Harder to test business logic
- ActiveRecord pattern couples domain and persistence
- Opinionated structure may limit architectural choices

**Decision:** Rejected - Too much framework coupling for our long-term goals

### Option 2: Simple MVC with Slim Framework

**Description:** Lightweight MVC using Slim PHP framework

**Pros:**
- Minimal overhead
- Easy to understand
- Fast to implement
- Good performance

**Cons:**
- Limited structure for complex business logic
- Tight coupling between layers
- Difficult to test in isolation
- No clear domain modeling

**Decision:** Rejected - Insufficient for complex business requirements

### Option 3: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

**Description:** Implement ports and adapters pattern

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of core and periphery
- Excellent testability
- Framework independence
- Well-defined interfaces

**Cons:**
- Similar complexity to Clean Architecture
- Less prescriptive than Clean Architecture
- Team familiarity with Clean Architecture

**Decision:** Considered but Clean Architecture chosen for its clearer layer definitions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Establish basic layer structure
   - Create domain entities (Transcription, User)
   - Implement basic value objects
   - Set up repository interfaces

2. **Phase 2**: Implement application layer
   - Create command and query handlers
   - Implement application services
   - Set up event system

3. **Phase 3**: Build infrastructure layer
   - Implement repository concrete classes
   - Create external service adapters
   - Set up persistence layer

4. **Phase 4**: Create interface layer
   - Implement REST controllers
   - Add GraphQL resolvers
   - Create CLI commands

5. **Phase 5**: Testing and validation
   - Unit tests for domain logic
   - Integration tests for repositories
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Success Metrics

How will we know if this decision was successful?

- **Test Coverage**: >90% coverage for domain and application layers
- **Development Velocity**: New features can be implemented without modifying existing layers
- **Bug Reduction**: Fewer bugs related to business logic
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developers find the code easier to work with
- **Performance**: No regression in API response times
