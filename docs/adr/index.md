# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains all architectural decision records for the Intelligent Transcription project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Index

| ID | Title | Status | Date |
|----|-------|--------|----- |
| [001](001-clean-architecture.md) | Adopt Clean Architecture for Backend | Accepted | 2024-05-30 |
| [002](002-vue3-composition-api.md) | Use Vue.js 3 with Composition API for Frontend | Accepted | 2024-05-30 |

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: The ADR is written and under review
2. **Accepted**: The ADR has been approved and should be implemented
3. **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer valid but kept for historical reference
4. **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the [template](template.md) to a new file
2. Use the next available number (e.g., `003-title.md`)
3. Fill out all sections thoroughly
4. Submit for review via pull request
5. Update this index when the ADR is accepted

## Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Clearly state what decision is being made
- **Include context**: Explain why this decision is needed
- **Consider alternatives**: Document other options that were considered
- **Think about consequences**: Include both positive and negative impacts
- **Keep it concise**: ADRs should be readable and focused
- **Use simple language**: Avoid jargon where possible
