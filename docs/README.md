- **YouTube Integration**: Transcribe content directly from YouTube URLs (including Shorts)
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic language detection with support for numerous languages
- **Smart Paraphrasing**: Improve transcription clarity with AI-powered text reformulation
- **Contextual Chat**: Ask questions about transcribed content and get intelligent responses
- **Export Options**: Download transcriptions and chat histories as text files
- **Customizable Language Options**: Force translation to a specific language

## =ï¿½ Tech Stack

### Backend

- **PHP 8.1+**: Core application logic and API management
- **Python 3.9+**: AI model integration and audio processing
- **OpenAI APIs**:
  - Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion
  - GPT models for paraphrasing and contextual chat

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core frontend technologies
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Twig**: Template engine for rendering views

### External Services

- **OpenAI API**: For transcription, paraphrasing, and chat
- **Loader.to API**: For downloading YouTube videos

## =ï¿½ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Composer (for PHP dependencies)
- pip (for Python dependencies)
- OpenAI API key
- Video Download API key (for YouTube functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd intelligent-transcription
   ```

2. **Create and configure the environment file (Secure Option)**:
   
   For enhanced security, we recommend storing sensitive configuration outside the web root:
   
   ```bash
   # Create a secure directory for environment variables
   mkdir -p ../inteligent-transcription-env
   
   # Copy the environment template
   cp .env.example ../inteligent-transcription-env/.env
   
   # Set secure permissions
   chmod 600 ../inteligent-transcription-env/.env
   
   # Edit the file with your API keys
   nano ../inteligent-transcription-env/.env
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can create the `.env` file in the project root, but with added security precautions:
   
   ```bash
   # Copy the environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Set secure permissions
   chmod 600 .env
   
   # Edit the file with your API keys
   nano .env
   ```
   
   Required environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_API_KEY=your_video_download_api_key
   PARAPHRASER_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id_if_you_have_one
   APP_ENV=development
   APP_DEBUG=true
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**:

   ```bash
   ./setup_env.sh
   ```

   This script will:

   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Configure the environment for OpenAI API access

4. **Start the application with the custom PHP configuration**:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -c php.ini
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Security Notes

The application implements several security measures:

- **Environment Variables**: Securely stored, with options for placement outside web root
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **File Security**: Random filenames and nested storage for uploaded files
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error processing with detailed logging
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background tasks for long-running operations

For detailed security documentation, see [docs/security.md](./security.md).
